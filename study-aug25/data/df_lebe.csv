I believe the latin community and African American communities feel the most left behind. I agree to some extent, but I also feel that these communities as a whole use this as a crutch vs. doing the right thing. For example, how many illegal immigrants are here and when you ask them why they haven't applied for citizenship, they say it is too hard. But I ask, have you tried to start the process and if you have and they say no, what is the reason. The response is usually, I haven't tried and the reason is most of the time, because I have a bad background or history. So that is not being left behind, you are either ""not trying"" or you are ""paying the consequences for your life decisions"". When it comes to African Americans, I also believe there are alot of excuses. For example, how many times do you see a news article on police abuse....but usually, the ""victim"" is someone who committed a crime and won't follow instructions by the police. Then when it turns south, we have lawyers and the community crying racism. If people would just follow the rules of law and then follow the orders of the police, alot of ""problems"" would naturally go away. I am a white male and most people would say I have privilege, but that is not the case. I had hard discussions with my kids as they were growing up that whether you think you are right or wrong, you obey police orders if you get pulled over. And if you feel you were wronged, there is a way to pursue that instead of creating a worse situation by responding negatively to the police.

"PJ842kp","Right now many different types of people are being left behind in the United States. There is a class of people who have literally lost their livelihoods because of technological change and climate change. Coal miners are an example of this, as are people being displaced by AI tools. Then there's a wide class of people being left behind because of tribalism. I count African Americans among this group, but racial discrimination is not the only kind of discrimination being applied here. If you aren't part of the correct social status you'll be left behind to some extent. If you aren't part of an accepted church you'll be left behind. Tribalism is a very powerful force that causes almost all of us to want to advance our own family interests above society interests and fairness. Then there are those of us who aren't legally sophisticated, being left behind by those who have a sophisticated understanding of (and willingness to influence) the legal system. Those of us who follow rules are being left behind by lawless corporate leaders like Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who view legal constraints as a challenge to be overcome by clever lawyering, lobbying, and even bribery (contributing massive amounts of money to campaign warchests is bribery in my opinion). If I were to actually pick a single person who is being left behind and describe that person, it is a Black person who grew up in the projects, knows nothing about the value of reading during elementary school so refuses to learn to read, and is then unable to get any job but the most menial.

For thirty years, he worked the same line at a manufacturing plant, a job his father had before him.It was hard work but it was reliable. It paid morgage on his modest three bedroomed house, put his two kids through community college and promised a pension that meant he and his wife could eventually retire with dignity. Then the plant closed. It moved operations overseas, and the town's main source of pride and paychecks dried up overnight. Ben tried to retrain, like they told him to, but sitting in a classroom with kids half his age , learning to code felt pointless. Those jobs,all seem to be in coastal cities he's never seen, for companies that feel a million miles away from his reality. Now he drives for a delivery app, his pension is a faded memory replaced a shaky smaller one and he feels utterly invinsible. He sees the world changing rapidly through his phone screen- a constant stream of news about booming stock markets,new tech gadgets, and cultural debates about pronouns and privileges he doesnt feel he has.He hears politicians talk about building back better but the new factory on the edge of town is automated requiring only a handful of highly skilled engineers. He feels left behind because the rules of the game changed midway through his life. The value of hard physical labor, the conerstone of his identity and self worth, seems to have evaporated.

"GJ065zj","I honestly think the middle section of the country is being left behind because the two extreme sides of the political spectrum who are always screaming about their needs are actually getting everything they want. I am sick of progressives being pandered to by Dems and never even getting off their couch to vote. I am tired of the Democrats letting them spew antisemitic beliefs and bully anyone who they deem too old or not social media worthy. They forced Biden off the ticket and got away with it. They forced Kamala to choose Walz over Shapiro because they didn’t like that Shapiro was Jewish, and guess what? We lost Pennsylvania and the election as a result. Stop listening to them. These kids in their 20s believe every stupid thing they hear, every campaign lie from GOP, and they use it as an excuse to stay lazy and never vote. “Oh, Biden is to blame for TikTok being shut down, I’m not voting.” Fact check, Trump passed the law that it would be shut down, and then he flipped on it and lied to them so they would vote for him or not vote. They are too lazy and ignorant to know when he is lying right to their faces. Same for the war on Israel. They blamed Biden. So tell me, how has Trump fixed it like these little brats said he would? Their protest votes and refusals to vote are the very reason we lost this last election, and the country at this point. Same for maga. Clearly. I’m tired of them screaming about being left behind over things like egg prices. The “left behind” group in my rural area of Illinois are driving around massive trucks, taking vacations repeatedly, going to the lake with their boats and RVs every weekend, playing on their $20,000 UTVs. Each one of their kids has a truck or a car, yet somehow I never see any of their family members working. How is this possible? Now they have everything they said they wanted and the entire country is heading straight into an economic depression, because, again, they believe every lie he has fed them. They are selfish, entitled, violent, racist, and hateful bigots and religious zealots. Do you know who the real left behind group is now? Sensible, moderate, hardworking people. People who have given up part of their former political beliefs to just try to unite and come together to save this county. Yet the extremes won’t let it happen. They throw our election every single time, and the Democratic Party refuses to stop pandering to the far far left. The right side will never change, so what’s our game plan? This two-party system is not working. We, the center of this country, are fighting for everyone’s rights, but we can’t succeed if these kids don’t care about anyone but themselves, their Taco Bell, and their damn video games. The people who are at the far fringes of both parties don’t care at all about other people’s rights or the rule of law. I’m over it. I am a lifelong Democrat, and I’m just tired of everyone. What we need to fix this country is a moderate Democrat, or even a former Republican like Kinzinger, to come along and fix this country for the truly left behind majority of this country, which is the middle, moderates. I would vote for Kinzinger. I would vote for Pritzker or Newsom as long as they don’t give in to the extreme left like the party did in this last election. Hell, I’d vote for W. at this point, but what I would really love to see is another term from Obama because he could truly fix this country. He is a progressive, but he’s smart about it. It’s real for him. He is not extreme. He isn’t irrational about it. He truly cares about everyone and their rights. Someone needs to reform our country and teach these younger generations the error of their ways. It should be him. I don't believe in third terms for presidents. It’s unconstitutional, but at this point we are losing everything because Dems won’t fight the right way. If Trump is running, why the hell can’t we fight him back with his very own illegal actions to make a point? Let Obama run. Then, when he wins, we need a Constitutional convention and we need to reform our entire system. This is not working. There are zero checks and balances currently.
